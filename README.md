# Spring-micro-benchmarks
Spring micro-benchmark covers Spring's core features. These features are annotated with special annotations in the program, including:

* four Spring features analyses: entry point (@EntryPointTag), dependency injection  by singleton (@SingletonDITag) or prototype (@PrototypeDITag) pattern, and  Spring AOP (AOPCheckTag).
*  two scenes analyses that influenced by Spring features: information leakage (@InfoLeakTag) and permission verification (@HasPermissionTag).
